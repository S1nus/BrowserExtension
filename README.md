#Dislike for Twitter

This is an extension for the Chrome browser which adds a dislike button for Twitter, allowing you to keep track of what tweets you dislike while browsing. The button is added beside the retweet, like, comment, and direct message buttons on each tweet on your feed and looks like the heart-shaped like button, but upside down.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rbLZlWOHCI) of it in action!
